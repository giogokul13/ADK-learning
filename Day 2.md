# Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP

- Integrate with MCP Servers
- Custom Tools

## Build Custom Tools
  - Custom Tools are tools you build yourself using your own code and business logic. Unlike built-in tools that come ready-made with ADK, custom tools give you complete control over functionality.

# MCP
 - Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that lets agents use community-built integrations. Instead of writing your own integrations and API clients, just connect to an existing MCP server.
